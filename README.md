#Purpose (2017/06/03)
This is a visualizer for Labscribe 3 exported data. Right now it:
*Draw a few milliseconds (you decide) after every single stimulation
*Draw the mean signal per experiments (one experiment defined as stimulation with one particular voltage)
*Draw the mean signal of every stimulation strength onto one plot
*Summarize the average and standard deviation of amplitude per stimulation strength
*Save a skimmed raw table of ROI for further analysis
